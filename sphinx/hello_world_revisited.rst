Hello World Revisited
=====================

In our :ref:`getting-started-label example we deployed a simple skill similar to a Hello World App, in this example we
will use ASK Amy to generate template code for a Hello World skill and then deploy it to AWS.

ASK Amy will take an Alex intent schema json file as input and generate boiler-plate code that acts as a starting point
for development. In this example we will generate and deploy a simple "Hello World" skill. This skill unlike the Obama
Facts skill will be used strictly for improving our understanding of the ASK Amy Framework.
